### Short Notes on Salary Prediction Model

1. **Objective**: The goal of this project is to build a salary prediction model based on features such as **Age**, **Years of Experience**, **Education Level**, and **Gender** using the **Random Forest Regressor**.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Missing Values**: Replaced common missing value indicators (`'NA'`, `'NaN'`) with `NaN` and dropped rows with missing data.
   - **Outliers**: Filtered out low salaries (below 10,000) and rows with missing critical features.
   - **Feature Selection**: Kept only relevant features: `Age`, `Years of Experience`, `Gender`, `Education Level`, and `Salary`.
   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical features (`Gender`, `Education Level`) were encoded into numeric values using **One-Hot Encoding**.

3. **Model Training**:
   - The data was split into training and test sets (67% training, 33% testing).
   - **StandardScaler** was used to scale the features for better performance with the Random Forest model.
   - A **Random Forest Regressor** model was trained to predict salary based on the preprocessed features.

4. **Saving the Model**:
   - The trained model, scaler, and encoder were saved using `joblib` for later use in deployment.
   - Also saved the expected feature order for consistency during predictions.

5. **Deployment (Flask API)**:
   - A Flask API was set up to load the trained model and preprocess incoming requests for salary predictions.
   - The API accepts input data in JSON format, processes it, and returns the predicted salary.

### Conclusion:
The project successfully builds and deploys a **salary prediction model** using a **Random Forest Regressor**, which can predict salaries based on input features. The model is deployed via a Flask API for easy use in production environments.
